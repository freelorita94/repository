Hi, I'm PJ and this file is supposed to have my info in it.
My email address is pdrum3@gatech.edu, but there's already a lot of places to get that,
like on the wiki. It doesn't matter though, because now if you're looking for it its another place.
*Extra* Yes PJ is a nickname. My first name is Peter and my second name is Joseph. Hence, PJ. I 
usually just use Peter for official documents but every now and then I have people that use it
all the time.
